  abstract  = {Mobile applications have become a necessity in people’s daily lives, and more are being developed at this time. To increase the efficiency in developing mobile apps, cross-platform mobile app development framework is needed. Currently there are various types of mobile app development frameworks with their respective approaches, be it native apps, mobile web apps, widget based, bridging with javascript, and others. However, user adoption and retention to a mobile app is highly influenced by good user experience, which can be quantified by application performance. In this research, a series of experiment are conducted to measure the performance of several Android based mobile app development frameworks based on five parameters, namely cpu usage, memory usage, response time, frame rate and app size. The results of this study show Native Android application that is used as the baseline gives the best performance and then followed by widget based cross-platform development framework, i.e. Flutter.},
